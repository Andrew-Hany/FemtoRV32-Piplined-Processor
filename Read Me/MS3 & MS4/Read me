Notes :
 1) We worked on the bonus related to the multiplication and division on thursday 19th of Nov (yes, the night of the crisis)
    (6pm-11pm)  
    we just needed a couple of hours to get everything working correctly.Unfortunately, The VNC incident happened and we did not save the bonus work!
    Thankfully, we had a pre-final version of our work saved on our google drive.

    We got the PC again on saterday. We found a version of our work in the recycle pin that dates back to 9th Nov (10 days ago). 
    We though that it would save us time if we modified it instead of making a new project on vivado again. IT WAS NOT A WISE DECISION :")
    We spent the whole sunday and Monday just debbuging things that already worked previously correct! We did not have the time
    to continue (restart) the bonus part again.
    

*** Note ***
- All of this happened while , me and andrew , had a midterm on monday , a midterm on tuesday , a midterm on wednesday and other projects and assignments delivered this week.
