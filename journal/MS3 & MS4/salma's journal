Thursday 19th Nov  :  1) We started working on the bonus part of multiplication and division operations. (6pm-9:30pm)
                      2) We decided to continue working on the bonus at 1am but the VNC issue occured 
                         and it lasted for 14 hours without reaching to our PC nor files.

Friday   20th Nov  :  1) We got our PC at 4pm and found that files were deleted but we found an old out-dated version of our project that
                         dates back to 10/11, which was 10 days ealier.
Saterday 21th Nov     2) We started combining the old files with the recent ones. This process costed us 6+ hours of debugging stuff 
                         we already made sure previously that's working correctly! (6pm-2am) + we lost 
                         what we did in the bonus part cause we did not have a packup for :")
                      3) We tried to support JALR (2am-6am)
